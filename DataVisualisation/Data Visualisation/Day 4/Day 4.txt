Measure - A numeric value(with/without decimal) on which statistics can be performed to get meaningful result. Primary key cannot be a measure
Eg: Profit, sales, no. of employees etc.

Dimension - Any string, numeric(primary key) or date value that is taken to group measure 
Eg: Market, city, segment, birth date etc.

Important dimensions: DoB, Employee DoJ
Age and survey rating can be taken as either a dimension or measure depending on the scenario  

Only math function possible on dimensions is COUNT

The combination of both dimension and visualization is called is called visulaization
Eg: Sales by state, profit by category

Tableau
-------
The 3 major components of tableau are:
1. Worksheet
2. Dashboard
3. Story

Joining multiple tables:
1) JOIN(Pre 2020) - Data is joined from tables before visualization
   Types of Join:
	1. Equi join(Inner join)
	2. Left outer join
	3. Right outer join
	4. Full outer join
2) Relationship(Post 2020) - Data is joined only after visualization starts

Symbols:
# - Numeric
Abc - Alphanumeric/String
Calender Icon - Date field
Globe Icon - Geographic field

Color Scheme:
Blue - Dimension
Green - Measure

Sorting on colums:
1. Ascending
2. Descending
3. Default(Data source)

There are 9 sections in tableau:
1. Dimensions
2. Measures
3. Pages
4. Filters
5. Marks
6. Colums
7. Row
8. Canvas
9. Show Me

The only graph that doesn't need any dimensions is histogram

Fields given in italics are those fields provided by tableau

There are 4 types of layouts:
1. Sandard
2. Fit width
3. Fit height (Used when you want to stretch the rows to cover your entire screen)
4. Entire view

To make a proper worksheet, pick the dimension with the least unique values as a column and that with many values as rows
