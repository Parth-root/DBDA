Validate two conditions using AND function

Finding outliers

Coefficient of Correlation (R)		-> -1 to +1
Coefficient of Determination (R^2)	-> 0 to 1

R indicates whether the correlation is +ve, -ve or if there exists no correlation between two variables.
R^2 indicates the strength of the relationship between two numeric variables. Value close to 1 is always preferred.

Bar Graph: To represent total sum or average
Histogram: 
	   - Total count (Shows number of values in a range[bin])
	   - Size of bin will remain equal throughout the graph
	   - One element can exist in only one bin at a time
Line Chart: It's exclusively used with time series data

Data consolidation - Combining data from different soruces (here, sheets)
While combining different sheets make sure that the spellings are correct



Pivot Tables
------------
- Based on the principle of aggregation, i.e., going from a detailed form of data to a summarized form of data. 
- For building a pivot table, atleast one categorical(qualitative) data must be present
- Full dates are considered as qualitative data and not quantitaive data
- The only thing you can do with categorical data is to take count of that data
