Area Chart
----------
It's a variation of line chart except that there is some shading below the line. Works in both discrete and continuous lines.



Tree Map
--------
- Used to reprsent graphs using primary key:foregin key relationship 
- It's exactly same as a bubble graph, except that the dimensions are shown as rectangles
- And just like bubble charts it can't handle negative data
- Size and colour of rectangles are proportional to the value
- Tree maps doesn't support sorting 


Scatter Plot
------------
It's used to compare two variables with numeric values, typically with decimal

1. Without Aggregation
2. With Aggregation



Histogram
---------
Example: Superstore_3 -> Sales Histogram (Bin size 500)

	Bin size = 500
	Bin1 = 0 to 499
	There are 44538(86%) records having sales value between 0 to 499 
	Bin2 = 500 to 999
	There are 4126(8%) records having sales value between 500 to 999



Bullet Graph vs Dual Line/Combination Graph
--------------------------------------
- The main difference is that for dual line/combo graph the date field is mandatory.
- Bullet grpah is used to compare actual vs expected values of non data variables while dual line/combo is used in time series analysis.
