Charts
------
Pie chart - Always used with percentages. Can handle negative values. Not generally used when more than 6 variables are present (elsewise, it becomes cluttered)

Bubble chart - Never used with percentages. Cannot handle negative values

Bar charts:
	1. Nornal - Used when there is only one dimension

	2. Side by side - Used when number of values in both dimensions are less
			  Total bars created = No. of values in dimension 1 * No. of values in dimension 2
			  Dimensions must be kept in columns
	3. Stacked bar -  Used when number of values in either dimension are high 

			  The bar chart is started/created with the dimension having more values and then the other dimension is added on top of that
			  100% stacked bar is used to show % values on the bar

Line charts:
	1. Discrete Line (Blue) - Used for comparison between different dimensions

	2. Continuous Line (Green) - Used for finding trends (forcating)

	Note: Alaways place date field on column as line charts are always represented horizontally

	Time Series Data involves Year/QuarterMonth/Week/Day wise data
