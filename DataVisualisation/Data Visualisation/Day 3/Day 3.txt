PMT - Payment function. Used to calculate payment for a loan
    - rate, nper, pv (nper: Number of payments, pv: Payment value)

For EMI calaculation, take rate and nper(tenure) in months
For FD calaculation, take rate in years

FV - Future value
   - rate, nper, pmt, pv
   - pmt should be 0
   - pv should be given as -ve



What if Analysis
----------------- 
- It's a form of Perspective Analysis
- Goal Seek: Set the value of one particular cell to a desired value by changing the value in another cell
- Scenario Manager: To set the values of multiple cells at the same time


Prediction
----------
Forecasting: It's done on time series data (Eg: Simple moving average-SMA) 
Prediction: Can be done for numeric or categorical variables

X axis Variable - Independant Variable
Y axis Variable - Dependant/Response Variable

Prediction is always done for dependant variable
Prediction is performed by using the line equation of the form y=mx+c [m is slope(coefficient), c is intercept]
