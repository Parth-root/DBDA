Trend Line
----------
- R^2 value closer to 1 is preferable

Example: Superstore_4 -> Sales vs Profit by Market (Trend Line)

	Africa:	Profit = 0.248583*Sales + -23.1004
	APAC: Profit = 0.162542*Sales + -13.3462
	Canada: Profit = 0.31346*Sales + -8.2342
	EMEA: Profit = 0.161284*Sales + -17.1253
	EU: Profit = 0.173187*Sales + -13.6008
	LATAM: Profit = 0.148977*Sales + -9.79541
	US: Profit = 0.180067*Sales + -12.7329
	
	- Inference: If the company achieves sales of $X then the company will earn a profit of <result of above equation with sales = X> 



Forecast
--------
- Date field and Line chart are compulsory for forcast



Clustering
----------
- Grouping together similar data into specific groups
- Example: K means clustering
- It's achieved using a scatter plot



Table Calculations
------------------
1. Running total
2. Difference - Typically used with time series data
3. Percent difference
4. Rank
5. Percentage of total - Typically used with pie chart
6. Moving average - It's exclusive to time series analysis

Table calculations involves all elements within the table
Pane is a panel or a particular section within the table. Pane calculations involves the elements within that pane only.

Attribute - If there are multiple records with the same value, then it will show each record individually



Data Blending
-------------
1. Primary Data Source
2. Secondary Data Source

- To combine data from different data sources, the data present in each different file should have some relation between them, i.e., some common column should be present between them
- Starting point of visualization should start from some filed present in the primary data source
- There can be only one primary data source
- Primary source is shown with a blue color and secondary source is shown with an orange color
- Blending only allows one type of joining which is Left-Outter Join
